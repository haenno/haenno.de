# haenno.de

This repo contains the source code for my personal website [haenno.de](https://haenno.de).

My local raspberry pi is running a script that pulls the latest version of this repo automatically.

Currently the content of this site is being pushed from [haenno/vue-tf](https://github.com/haenno/vue-tf).

The raspberry pi itself runs with this setup [haenno/haenno.de](https://github.com/haenno/haenno.de)  (what is just an ssl enhanced copy of <https://github.com/haenno/traefik-docker-compose-grafana-prometheus-loki-promtail-portainer>).
